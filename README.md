# securefix-server

Securefix Action server repository for `civitaspo` repositories.

The server workflow receives Securefix client requests through `securefix-*` label events and creates signed fix commits with the server GitHub App.

## Required configuration

Create a GitHub App for the server and install it into this repository and the client repositories.

Repository variables and secrets:

- Variable `SECUREFIX_SERVER_APP_ID`
- Secret `SECUREFIX_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY`

The server app needs these permissions:

- `contents: write`
- `actions: read`
- `pull_requests: write`
- `workflows: write`

`workflows: write` is required because the current client use case fixes files under `.github/workflows`.
